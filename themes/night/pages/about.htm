					Hello, My name is Yosef Zev Jotkowitz, Zev is Wolf in hebrew hence The Website Wolf. A freelance nomad with a home in Israel, slowly making his way, experiencing the wonders of the world and catering websites as my professional practice for locals and clients abroad.<br/>
					Programing has been a passion of mine since being first exposed to JavaScript as a teenager and the Designer in me found its way into my heart spending long weeks in nature. I've combined the two into designing websites.

					My travels have given me an appreciation of quality made projects. I have put much hard work and dedication into the skill of building websites, and have reached a state where I can keep coming back to my projects with the same energy, like a painter stroking his work throughout the days, as his work develops a personality, it becomes a masterpiece.
